# Personal Agentic AI Assistant

## Project Description
This project implements a personal assistant powered by an agentic AI. It can help you with your daily personal tasks, such as browsing the web and sending emails. It is built using **LangGraph** and follows an **Evaluator/Worker** design pattern from [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents). The assistant's capabilities are extended through the integration of various **tools**.
