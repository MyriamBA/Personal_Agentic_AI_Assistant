# Personal Agentic AI Assistant

## Project Overview
This project implements a personal assistant powered by an agentic AI. It can help you with your daily personal tasks, such as browsing the web and sending emails. It is built using LangGraph and follows an Evaluator/Worker design pattern from [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents),
where a supervisor agent delegates tasks to specialized worker agents and evaluates their output to ensure the final result is accurate and meets the user's needs. The assistant's capabilities are extended through the integration of various tools.
